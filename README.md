I am currently a PhD candidate at the Australian National Univerisity and Data61, CSIRO, under supervision of A/Prof. [Cheng Soon Ong](http://www.ong-home.my/index.html), Prof. [Lexing Xie](http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~xlx/) and Prof. [Eduardo Eyras](https://jcsmr.anu.edu.au/people/academics/professor-eduardo-eyras). Prior to that, I obtained my bachelor degree with first-class honour at the Australian National University bachelor degree at Shandong University in 2018. 

My research interests are online experimental design in machine learning, including multi-armed bandits and active learning. I work on both theoretical and practical view of experimental design with two goals:
(I) designing robust algorithms to reflect the preference of agents, for example, risk-aversion. 
Understanding the concentration of measures and adaptive strategies involved. 
(II) I am interested in using machine learning algorithms for synthetic biology experimental design. 
Designing the pipeline and recommendation strategies from a practical point of view.
