I am Mengyan Zhang (张梦妍), a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Oxford, working with Prof. [Seth Flaxman](https://sethrf.com/). I am a research member of common room in [Kellogg College](https://www.kellogg.ox.ac.uk/). 
Before that, I received my PhD at the Australian National University, under the supervision of Dr. [Cheng Soon Ong](http://www.ong-home.my/index.html), Prof. [Lexing Xie](http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~xlx/) and Prof. [Eduardo Eyras](https://jcsmr.anu.edu.au/people/academics/professor-eduardo-eyras). 
I was affiliated with Data61, CSIRO and interned at Microsoft Research Asia during my PhD. 
I'm also short-termly mentored by [Sebastien Bubeck](http://sbubeck.com/) via the [WiML-T Mentoring Program](https://www.wiml-t.org/mentoring-program) in 2021. 
Prior to that, I obtained my bachelor's degree with first-class honours at the Australian National University and bachelor's degree at Shandong University in 2018 ([2 + 2 joint degree program](https://cecs.anu.edu.au/study/meet-our-students/mengyan-zhang)). 

My research interests are sequential decision-making in machine learning, including multi-armed bandits and active learning. I work on both theoretical and practical views of experimental design with two goals:
(I) Designing robust algorithms to handle imperfect feedback and understand causal relationships in sequential decision-making. (II) Designing decision-making algorithms to solve real-world problems in various areas, for example, synthetic biology, global health, survey design, and public policy.
