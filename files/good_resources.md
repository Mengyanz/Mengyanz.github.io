# Good Resources 

Collections of resources (for machine learning, math, statistics) that I wish I could have known them earlier...  
not a comprehensive list, please let me know (email or Twitter) if you want to add any!

## Courses 

- [Learning from data](https://work.caltech.edu/telecourse): introductory Machine Learning online course, taught by Caltech Professor Yaser Abu-Mostafa (one of the most amazing lecturers I've ever met!). A learning theory-oriented machine learning course. 
- [Stanford cs231n: CNN](): introduction for deep learning (CNN, RNN, CV oriented)
- [Deep Learning NYU - Yann LeCun & Alfredo Canziani](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLHTzKZzVU9eaEyErdV26ikyolxOsz6mq): course run in 2020,  website/notes [here](https://atcold.github.io/pytorch-Deep-Learning/) 
- [Statistics from Professor Leonard](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5102DFDC6790F3D0): the courses are quite easy to follow and interesting! Learn some basic statistics concepts there.
- [Bioinformatics by Pavel Pevzner](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/bioinformatics)

## Tutorials

- [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw): Excellent short tutorials with vivid illustration and clear explanation. Series I found interesting and useful: [COVID19](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDOcxqQ36Vow3TdTRjkdSvT-), [Essence of linear algebra](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab), [Essence of calculus](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr)
- [The Bright Side of Mathematics](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdwo4k1RQHTcq_-WS7Cazqg): very clear and intuitive! I learn [Measure Theory](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBh2i93oe2qvMVqAzsX1Kuv6-4fjazZ8j) there!

#### Gaussian Process
- [Deep Gaussian Process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHTGY8VCinY&feature=share): Neil D. Lawrence - NIPS Tutorial 2017

#### Knowledge Graph

#### Deep Learning related 
- [brief intro to Transformer in 10min](https://youtu.be/TQQlZhbC5ps): by CodeEmporium
<!-- - [The Annotated Transformer](http://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/2018/04/03/attention.html) -->
- [NLP_ability git repo (in Chinese)](https://github.com/DA-southampton/NLP_ability): a comprehensive summary of NLP-related stuff, suitable for beginners. I know this from a good explanation to Transformer [video](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Di4y1c7Zm). 
- [A tutorial for PyTorch by Aladdin Persson](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhhyoLH6IjfxeoooqP9rhU3HJIAVAJ3Vz): very detailed and easy-to-follow. Highly recommended!


## Summer Schools

- [Machine Learning Summer School](http://mlss.cc/): I attended [MLSS2020](http://mlss.tuebingen.mpg.de/2020/) and learnt a lots from the amazing [speakers](http://mlss.tuebingen.mpg.de/2020/speakers.html) and also participators. Good places to make friends and discuss your research ideas! 
- [Gaussian Process Summer School](http://gpss.cc/)

## Books

- [Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning](), [Foundations of machine learning](): textbooks of machine learning
- [Gaussian Process for Machine Learning]()
- [Mathematics for Machine Learning](https://mml-book.github.io/): provides the necessary mathematical skills to read those other machine learning books. Highly recommended for beginners!
- [Algebra, Topology, Differential Calculus, and Optimization Theory
For Computer Science and Machine Learning](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~jean/math-deep.pdf): A very comprehensive and well-written book from Jean Gallier and Jocelyn Quaintance. 
- [Bandits Algorithms by Tor Lattimore and Csaba Szepesvari](https://tor-lattimore.com/downloads/book/book.pdf)

## Websites/Blogs

- [Simons Institute for Theory of Computing](https://simons.berkeley.edu/): good online [programs/events](https://simons.berkeley.edu/programs) upcoming!
- [I'm a bandits-Sébastien Bubeck](https://blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/): Random topics in optimization, probability, and statistics.

## Mentoring

- [mentor.net](https://mementor.net/): I went several mentoring sessions during NeurPIS2020, they were quite good. There are also some from time to time. 

## My favorite TED talks 
- [Uri Alon: Why truly innovative science demands a leap into the unknown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1U26PLiXjM&list=PLK-PE2jEItbewqeYePUZQ4hbWiwEmSLzg&index=5): Being supportive and say: Yes! And?
- [The first 20 hours -- How to learn anything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MgBikgcWnY&list=PLK-PE2jEItbewqeYePUZQ4hbWiwEmSLzg&index=6): You do not need 10-thousand hours to LEARN something, but only 20 hours (well, you do need more time to become an expert). 
- [How language shapes the way we think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKK7wGAYP6k&list=PLK-PE2jEItbewqeYePUZQ4hbWiwEmSLzg&index=8): "To have a second language is to have a second soul" -Charlemagne.
