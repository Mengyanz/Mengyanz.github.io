# Good Resources 

Collections of resources that I wish I could have known them earlier...  
not a comprehensive list, please let me know (email or Twitter) if you want to add any!

## Courses 

- [Learning from data](https://work.caltech.edu/telecourse): introductory Machine Learning online course, taught by Caltech Professor Yaser Abu-Mostafa (one of the most amazing lecturers I've ever met!). A learning theory-oriented machine learning course. 
- [Stanford cs231n: CNN](): introduction for deep learning (CNN, RNN, CV oriented)
- [Deep Learning NYU - Yann LeCun & Alfredo Canziani](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLHTzKZzVU9eaEyErdV26ikyolxOsz6mq): course run in 2020,  website/notes [here](https://atcold.github.io/pytorch-Deep-Learning/) 
- [Statistics from Professor Leonard](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5102DFDC6790F3D0): the courses are quite easy to follow and interesting! Learn some basic statistics concepts there.


## Tutorials

- [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw): Excellent short tutorials with vivid illustration and clear explanation. Series I found interesting and useful: [COVID19](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDOcxqQ36Vow3TdTRjkdSvT-), [Essence of linear algebra](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab), [Essence of calculus](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr)
- [The Bright Side of Mathematics](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdwo4k1RQHTcq_-WS7Cazqg): very clear and intuitive! I learn [Measure Theory](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBh2i93oe2qvMVqAzsX1Kuv6-4fjazZ8j) there!

## Summer Schools

- [Machine Learning Summer School](http://mlss.cc/): I attended [MLSS2020](http://mlss.tuebingen.mpg.de/2020/) and learnt a lots from the amazing [speakers](http://mlss.tuebingen.mpg.de/2020/speakers.html) and also participators. Good places to make friends and discuss your research ideas! 

## Books

- [Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning](), [Foundations of machine learning](): textbooks of machine learning
- [Gaussian Process for Machine Learning]()
- [Mathematics for Machine Learning](https://mml-book.github.io/): provides the necessary mathematical skills to read those other machine learning books. Highly recommended for beginners!
- [Bandits Algorithms]()
- [Introduction to Reinforcement Learning]()

## Websites/Blogs

- [Simons Institute for Theory of Computing](https://simons.berkeley.edu/): good online [programs/events](https://simons.berkeley.edu/programs) upcoming!
