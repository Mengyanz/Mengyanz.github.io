I am currently a PhD candidate at the Australian National Univerisity and Data61, CSIRO, under supervision of Dr. [Cheng Soon Ong](http://www.ong-home.my/index.html), Prof. [Lexing Xie](http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~xlx/) and Prof. [Eduardo Eyras](https://jcsmr.anu.edu.au/people/academics/professor-eduardo-eyras). 
I'm also short-termly mentored by [Sebastien Bubeck](http://sbubeck.com/) via the [WiML-T Mentoring Program](https://www.wiml-t.org/mentoring-program) in 2021. 
Prior to that, I obtained my bachelor degree with first-class honour at the Australian National University and the bachelor degree at Shandong University in 2018 ([2 + 2 joint degree program](https://cecs.anu.edu.au/study/meet-our-students/mengyan-zhang)). 

My research interests are online experimental design in machine learning, including multi-armed bandits and active learning. I work on both theoretical and practical views of experimental design with two goals:
(I) designing robust algorithms to reflect the preference of agents, for example, risk-aversion. 
Understanding the concentration of measures and adaptive strategies involved. 
(II) Using machine learning algorithms for synthetic biology experimental design. 
Designing the pipeline and recommendation strategies from a practical point of view.
